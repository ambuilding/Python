### Risk Return Analysis

- Example: TAN is the ticker for a solar ETF.
- FSLR, RGSE, and SPWR are tickers of companies that build or lease solar panels. Each has a different business model.
- We'll use pandas to study the risk reward tradeoff between the 4 investments and also see how correlated they are

- We'll plot the mean and std or returns for each ticker to get a sense of the risk return profile

- Standard deviations, the risk


#### Draw a plot that plots the risk-reward, risk-return trade-off for each of these four tickers.
