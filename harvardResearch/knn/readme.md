## 3.3 k-Nearest Neighbors classification kNN

- determine the Euclidean distance between two points expressed as NumPy arrays
- find the most common vote in an array or sequence of votes
- Compare two different methods for finding the most common vote
- The most commonly occurring element in a sequence is called mode in statistics.
  - Finding a mode is a common statistics operation.
- find the nearest neighbors of an observation, use it to predict the class of an observation
- generate synthetic data
- make a prediction grid, use enumerate / NumPy meshgrid
- plot the prediction grid, the bias-variance tradeoff
- apply the homemade kNN classifier to a real dataset
  -Compare the performance of the homemade kNN classifier to the performance of the kNN classifier from the scikit-learn module
  - a classic data set created by Ron Fisher in 1933
  - it consists of 150 different iris flowers
  - 50 from each of three different species.
  - For each flower, we have the following covariates:
    - sepal length/width
    - petal length/width
