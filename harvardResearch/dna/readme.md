### Introduction to DNA Translation

- 3.1 the four DNA nucleotides
- the central dogma of molecular biology
  - Think of DNA as a one dimensional string of characters with four characters to choose from.
  - characters: A, C, G and T.
  - stand for the first letters with the four nucleotides used to construct DNA.
  - Each unique three character sequence of nucleotides,
  - sometimes called a nucleotide triplet, corresponds to one amino acid.
- download DNA and protein sequence data from the NCBI
- import the DNA data into Python and remove special characters
- translate the DNA sequence using a dictionary lookup
- check the length of the sequence using the modulo operator

- A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module function, or a class, or a method definition, and it becomes part of that object.

- use the with statement to read in an entire file
- compare your translation to the protein sequence you downloaded
