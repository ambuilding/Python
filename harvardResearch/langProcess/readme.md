  - use the Counter tool from the collections module to accomplish the same task

- read in a book from a file
- compute some basic word frequency statistics
  - Use the word_stats function to compare different translations of the same book

- navigate file directories and read in multiple files/books at once
  -  pandas provides additional data structure and data analysis functionalities for Python

### Hamlet

- find and visualize summary statistics of the text of different translations of Hamlet.
- read in and store each translation of Hamlet.
- summarize the text for a single translation of Hamlet in a pandas dataframe`data`, define two columns, add columns.
- summarize the statistics in `data` into a smaller pandas dataframe.`sub_data`
- join all the data summaries for text Hamlet translation.
- plot our results and look for differences across each translation.

- We see that the original English version of Hamlet contains fewer words overall, and its unique words are shorter than its translations.
